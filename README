Multiplatform library for using Microchip's MRF24J40MA modules.

This is designed to be _simple_ not high performance.  TX is easy,
RX expects the device to be always on, and only buffers a single packet at a time.

This is mostly used as a basis for my own work using these devices in my own projects.

Current status:
 * atmega32u4 (Teensy 2.0) Working fine
 * stm32f100 (STM32VL Discovery Board) Working fine (libopencm3 based)

Future:
 * stm32l1 (libopencm3 based)
 * stm32f100 (std periph lib based)
